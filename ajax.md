AJAX means Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It allows a web page to be updated without reloading the page and enables data to be requested to and from a server after the page has loaded.
The process works as follows:
1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
