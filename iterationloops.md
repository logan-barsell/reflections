ITERATION LOOPS allow for processes to be repeated to produce a series of outcomes or a specified result.

FOR loops repeat until a specified condition evaluates to false. 
The Syntax goes as follows:
```js
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; incrementExpression){
statement
}
```
The initialExpression is executed before the loop starts, the second statement defines the condition for running the loop, and the incrementExpression is executed after the loop has been executed.

WHILE loops repeat as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
The syntax goes as follows:
```js
while (condition) {
    statement
}
```
The condition test occurs before the statement is executed. If it returns true, it will run and then go through it again. If it returns false, the statement is not executed.
